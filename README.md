# COVERUP
A python program for Linux users to "Cover their tracks" on the terminal. The idea for COVERUP came to me after I read a section of "Red Team Field Manual" by Ben Clark (thanks Ben) about Linux terminal commands for "Covering your tracks".
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------# BELOW ARE A LIST OF SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
1. You must be running a Linux distro. (Any will do)...I think.
2. You'll probably need root access.
3. You'll probably need an up to date version of python.
